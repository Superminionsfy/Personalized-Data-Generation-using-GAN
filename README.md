# Personalized-Data-Generation-using-GAN

* Personalized data generation is to fill missing data in the dataset with customized requirements. This project dives into the application of Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to solve the nonlinear matrix completion problem.
* This file is for code peer review. It is for training the dataset of FEMNIST with DCGAN.

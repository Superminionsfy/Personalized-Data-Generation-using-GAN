# Personalized-Data-Generation-using-GAN

* Personalized data generation is to fill missing data in the dataset with customized requirements. This project dives into the application of Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) to solve the nonlinear matrix completion problem.
* These two files are for data preparation. One is to select the data from the FEMNIST. The link for FEMNIST dataset can be found in dataset_selection.py. The other file is to transfer the json file generated from dataset_selection.py. Run the dataset_selection.py first, then the transfer_to_image.py.
